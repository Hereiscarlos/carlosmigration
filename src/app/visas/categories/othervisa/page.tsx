          The 600 visa is designed for individuals who wish to explore
          Australia's treasures temporarily. To be eligible, you need to meet
          certain criteria, including:
        </p>
        <p>
          Genuine purpose of visit: You must have a genuine reason for visiting
          Australia, such as tourism, visiting friends or family, or engaging in
          business-related activities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Financial capacity: You should demonstrate that you have sufficient
          funds to cover your travel expenses, including accommodation,
          transportation, and daily costs, throughout your stay in Australia.
        </p>
        <p>
          Health and character requirements: Like any visa application, you need
          to meet the health and character requirements set by the Australian
          government. This may involve providing medical certificates or police
          clearance certificates.
        </p>
        <p>
          No intention to work: The 600 visa prohibits any form of work in
          Australia, so you must demonstrate that you have no intention to seek
          employment during your visit.
        </p>
        <h3 className=" font-semibold text-lg md:text-xl ">

          Duration of stay: The visa allows you to stay in Australia for a
          specified period, typically up to three, six, or twelve months. Ensure
          you comply with the allowed stay duration as specified on your visa.
        </p>
        <p>
          Multiple entries: The 600 visa often permits multiple entries, which
          means you can leave and re-enter Australia within the visa's validity
          period.
        </p>
        <p>
          Health insurance: While not mandatory, it is highly recommended to
          have appropriate health insurance coverage for the duration of your
          stay in Australia. This ensures peace of mind in case of any
          unforeseen medical circumstances.
