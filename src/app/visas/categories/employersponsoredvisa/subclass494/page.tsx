      </h1>
      <p>
        Hey there! Are you ready to explore the amazing opportunities Australia
        has to offer through the 494 visa? Let's dive into it together, in an
        informal, motivational, and easy-to-understand way!
      </p>
      <h2 className="  font-semibold text-xl md:text-2xl">Overview</h2>
      <p>
        The 494 visa, also known as the Skilled Employer-Sponsored Regional
        (Provisional) visa, is a pathway to live and work in regional areas of
        Australia. It allows skilled workers to contribute to the country's
        regional development while enjoying the incredible Australian lifestyle.
      </p>
      <h2 className="  font-semibold text-xl md:text-2xl">Eligibility</h2>
      <p>
        To be eligible for the 494 visa, you need to meet certain criteria. You
        must have a valid job offer from an Australian employer in a designated
        regional area. Additionally, you must have the skills, qualifications,
        and work experience that match the job requirements.
      </p>

      <h2 className="  font-semibold text-xl md:text-2xl">Conditions</h2>
      <p>
        Once you obtain the 494 visa, it opens up a world of possibilities. You
        can live, work, and study in a designated regional area of Australia for
        up to five years. This visa also provides a pathway to permanent
        residency through the Subclass 191 visa after three years, allowing you
        to settle in Australia permanently.
      </p>
      <h2 className="  font-semibold text-xl md:text-2xl">Requirements</h2>
      <p>
        To apply for the 494 visa, you'll need to gather some documents and meet
        specific requirements. This may include proof of your skills,
